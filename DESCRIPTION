Title: Analysis of Threat and Demography Scoring
Version: 0.1.0
Author: J. Malcom

Description: Analyses of scores for the threat status and demographic status of
    imperiled species. There are two analyses to illustrate the key used to
    generate the scores. First, we evaluate whether US Fish and Wildlife Service
    recommendations for status changes under the ESA are consistent with threat
    and demographic status scores. Second, we analyze scores from a set of 54
    ESA-listed species from Florida, and evaluate the repeatability of scores
    across different scorers.
