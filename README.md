## threatdemog

Data and analyses of threat and demographic status change scores for imperiled species. This package captures all of the components of our revision (to be resubmitted soon) of the manuscript at [PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/1860/). This and the R documentation will be updated when the paper is published.

### Installation

We do not plan to submit this package to CRAN, so `install.packages` won't work. But you can do

```
devtools::install_github("Defenders-ESC/threatdemog")
```

to install the package to your computer.
